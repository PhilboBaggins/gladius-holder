# Gladius holder

Wall mount holder for a plastic practice gladius I have. The holder is intended to be 3D printed and then stuck to the wall with double sided tape or screws. The sword can then be hung in the holder by it's pommel with the blade pointing down.

`gladius-holder.blend` is the source file for the model. It was designed in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and then the  `gladius-holder.stl` was exported for 3D printing.
